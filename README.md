# nearby-locations-project

This is a project that allows you to search for a particular category of places(malls, hotels, hospitals, parks....). And gives you the address of the nearest places around you based on that category.

This was made using mapmyindias api and using there 3rd party api services. The technoliges used to build the website were node js, express js and mongoose.
Please note that I am still working on this websites frontend part.
